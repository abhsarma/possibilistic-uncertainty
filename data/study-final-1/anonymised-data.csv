"98aaad2d","B","I sent blankets when there was a greater than 20% likelihood of the temperature being 32F. At 20% likelihood, blankets would only be necessary 20% of the time, or 20/100=2/10=1/5, and therefore once every five occurrences. So, every fifth occurrence, on average, would cost you $5000. And if you sent blankets each of the five times, it would also cost you $5000($1000 x 5).

When there is a greater than 20% chance that the temperature will be 32F, you always send blankets. This is because at the >20% likelihood, blankets will be necessary, on average, more than once every 5 occasions.

For example, let's say there was a 40% chance that the temperature would be 32F. Then, on average, you would need blankets 40/100=4/10=2/5, and therefore twice every five occurences, on average. So, without blankets, that would cost you 2 x $5000 = $10,000. However, sending blankets each night would have cost you $1000 x 5 = $5000. So, you would save $5000($10,000 - $5000) by using blankets every night.

So, do not send blankets if the chance of the temperature being 32F is less than 20%.

Send blankets every night if the chance of the temperature being 32F is more than 20%.

The break even point is when the chance of the temperature being 32F equaling exactly 20%. When I played the game, I did not send blankets figuring it was a waste of labor for the infinitesimal benefit.","5000","ensembles",1,"single",0,16
