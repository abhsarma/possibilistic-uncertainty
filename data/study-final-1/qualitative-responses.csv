I looked at the 32 degree temp first then looked at the overall probability for that temp, using an estimate of what I would feel the chances are then I looked at all the lines to see where they all fell and used my best judgement on if the blankets could be useful or not with the temp/probability."
"8f4cf670","pbox","-10000","A,C","I was looking at the highest point of both A and E and I followed that the E was highest so I decided that way. For the first task, I just looked at 32 and where it laid at."

"e1de0c51","pbox","10000","A,C","None of the distributions go over 30% so I think it is unnecessary to send blankets for the Alpacas. The probability is higher that the temp will not go lower than 30 degrees."

"5ed56976","ensembles","12000","A","My threshold for sending blankets was 50%. If the predictions was 49% or below, I would choose not to send blankets because the prediction is that it is more than likely not to be below 32 degrees. If the prediction was 50% or above, I chose to send blankets. In the instance of the multiple prediction scenario, I looked at the highest prediction because that'd be the worst case scenario (the highest possible chance). "
"cee21079","ensembles","6000","A","if all predictions were under around 30% chance, I wouldn't send them. if any of them were above 30, I would send them. I looked at the highest probability graph and the lowest probability graphs for the most part to make my decisions. "

"598965af","pbox","7000","A","I looked at the graph and noted the upper and lower percentage chances of the temperature falling below 32 deg, and generally if that upper percentage was above 40% I would issue blankets. Under that 40% limit I chose to not send blankets, given the odds that the temperature wouldn't drop below 32 deg."
"4c2ae6d8","pbox","3000","A","Given the severity of the possible negative outcome I went with the most conservative actions possible. So for these graphs with the p-boxes I went with the potentially worst possible forecast (line A) and ignored the rest of the lines/box. If that line showed a 15% or higher cumulative chance of the temps being below 32 degrees I sent blankets. That 15% choice was partially based on not wanting alpacas to die, but also the severity of the financial consequences of being wrong and my experience of how often temps were below 32 degrees in the first block. So for the specific graph above I would send blankets, as line A shows about a 30% cumulative chance for the low being 32 or below."
"f1eeec1f","pbox","10000","A,C","In the graph above I would not send blankets because the upper limit of the p-box (curve A) shows the probability of the temperature being less than or equal to 32 degrees is 30%. In addition, the lower limit of the p-box (curve C) being less than 10% (~7%) averages the probability out to be around  18.5% as seen by curve B. If the upper limit of the p-box was higher and the lower limit stayed the same I would have sent blankets since the chance of the temperature going below 32 degrees is more variable. However, if curve A was above 50% I would send A regardless of curve C or B just in case.

"6df65f0f","ensembles","6000","A","The key question we need to know is what is the likelihood that the temperature will be less than 32.  The curves give a few different probabilities, from less than 10 percent to 30%. From this I can guess that is is unlikely to be under 32 degrees, however how unlikely remains unknown. Curve C could correspond to reality in which case there is little chance of very cold weather whereas if A is closer it will be a much closer situation. The question then becomes one about risk tolerance, my willingness to risk the reward (and the punishment that comes with being wrong) based on my interpenetration of the data. In looking at the data, I weigh how much what each forecast is indicating to make an informed judgement about the risk for the cost. "
"b5a988b8","pbox","6000","Other (please describe)","I look at the graph above and see that at most you have a 30% need for blankets but likely less so I wouldn't send blankets on this one since there is a budget that I need to upkeep and If I sent blankets every single time it would mean eventually there are no blankets to send when it matters."
"5e58ef8f","ensembles","9000","A,B,C","I took into account all of the graphs. First I looked at graphs C and A, to see the highest and lowest percentages. Usually anything below ~25% I would consider safe not to send blankets. Next I would look at the spread, so if most of the graphs were on the lower side of 25%, then more than likely I would not send blankets. If several of the graphs were over 25%, then more than likely I would send blankets. If it was a wide range but still over 30% at the highest, i would send blankets just because of the variability."
"6ede9083","ensembles","10000","Other (please describe)","if I felt average chance was over 20 percent I sent blankets to mitigate risk of losing 5000.  The average cost of being wrong is higher there than spending $1000 to be safe "

"6598630f","pbox","12000","B","I did look at all three, but B seems to be the middle. I used the middle line to decide if I wanted to send blankets.  I also looked at the highest and lowest to determine how different those two lines were.  "
"52c0da4a","pbox","6000","A,C","Anything under 40% I decided not to send blankets because I felt the probability wasn't high enough. I used both A and C when I used this strategy. Anything that was over 40% I decided to send blankets because I felt it was better to be safe than sorry."
"d4619669","ensembles","10000","B","I felt like if the chances were under 30 percent, I was likely to not order blankets. I was a little looser with those guidelines as the task progressed as I was also trying to preserve but not jeopardize my bonus. If I felt like it was 30 or 40 percent or higher, I was sending blankets - I didn't want to risk 5k on a coin flip or worse."
"b37cf3a5","pbox","11000","B","I focused more on the middle to try and use more of an aggregate when deciding whether or not to send blankets and if it was more than 40ish percent I would send them and would not send them if it was below."
"a6a49d35","pbox","6000","A,C","My main goal was to avoid a 5,000 loss which represented almost 28% of my budget. I'd rather pay 1,000 (5% of budget unnecessarily) than lose 5,000, so I was hesitant to pick any option where the chance of the weather dropping below 32 degrees was non-zero.

Early on in the task, I would be a little riskier, so I would be sure to end the game with money in my budget. If the lower end was 5% and the higher was less than 20%, I would choose not to send blankets. If the probability was higher than that, I always sent blankets. After a few rounds, I always sent blankets unless the probability of the temp going below 32 was 0 at the low end and less than 10 at the high end. I was very cautious in my approach overall as a mistake was costly and I wanted to completely avoid running out of money at the end. "
"70e723d9","pbox","8000","A","I am going by the premise that if the chance of low temperature is predicted at 50% or below, I am not sending the blankets. I am using the uppermost distribution to determine the probability. "
"98aaad2d","ensembles","5000","B","I sent blankets when there was a greater than 20% likelihood of the temperature being 32F. At 20% likelihood, blankets would only be necessary 20% of the time, or 20/100=2/10=1/5, and therefore once every five occurrences. So, every fifth occurrence, on average, would cost you $5000. And if you sent blankets each of the five times, it would also cost you $5000($1000 x 5).

When there is a greater than 20% chance that the temperature will be 32F, you always send blankets. This is because at the >20% likelihood, blankets will be necessary, on average, more than once every 5 occasions.

For example, let's say there was a 40% chance that the temperature would be 32F. Then, on average, you would need blankets 40/100=4/10=2/5, and therefore twice every five occurences, on average. So, without blankets, that would cost you 2 x $5000 = $10,000. However, sending blankets each night would have cost you $1000 x 5 = $5000. So, you would save $5000($10,000 - $5000) by using blankets every night.

So, do not send blankets if the chance of the temperature being 32F is less than 20%.

Send blankets every night if the chance of the temperature being 32F is more than 20%.

The break even point is when the chance of the temperature being 32F equaling exactly 20%. When I played the game, I did not send blankets figuring it was a waste of labor for the infinitesimal benefit."
"9f15a112","pbox","9000","A,C,Other (please describe)","I would send blankets for the above graph because there is enough risk to warrant it. In this case, the plot shows the odds as between about 5% and 30%, which is a 25% difference. The models don't all particularly agree, so the uncertainty is relatively high. With a higher degree of uncertainty, it is best to act more safely, especially when livestock is at risk of death for getting it wrong."
"a4fd1201","ensembles","5000","B","I mostly looked at the lowest and highest peak, creating an average. If the low was extremely low (like 10% or less) and the highest was also relatively low such as being under 50% then I chose not to send the blankets. If the lowest was high (30% or so) and the highest was very high (80%+) then I chose to send the blankets. For the extreme cases I chose appropriately whether the percentage across all estimates was high or low. "

I tended to send blankets to the alpacas if the probability of line A was greater than 20-30%.
