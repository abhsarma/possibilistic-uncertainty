"486b6bc9","ensembles_right","-5000","C","Interpretation Strategy
Identify Temperature Threshold:

Locate the 32°F mark on the X-axis. This is your critical temperature for alpacas needing blankets.
Analyze Forecasts:

Look at the area under each curve or bar to see how much probability is assigned to temperatures below 32°F.
Calculate Average Probability:

Estimate Area: Approximate the total area under the curves to the left of 32°F.
Aggregate Data: Sum the probabilities provided by each agency for temperatures below 32°F.
Compute Average: Divide this total by the number of agencies (20) to get the average probability.
Assess Variability:

Check if there is a wide range of probabilities. If most agencies forecast a high probability of temperatures below 32°F, this increases your confidence in the risk.
Decision Making:

If the average probability is high (e.g., over 50%): Issue blankets to mitigate the risk of the $5,000 penalty.
If the average probability is low (e.g., below 50%): Consider not issuing blankets to conserve budget, but be aware of the risk of the penalty.
Example Calculation
Let’s say the graph shows the following probabilities from 5 out of 20 agencies for temperatures below 32°F:

Agency 1: 60%
Agency 2: 45%
Agency 3: 55%
Agency 4: 70%
Agency 5: 40%
Steps:

Sum Probabilities: 60% + 45% + 55% + 70% + 40% = 270%
Average Probability: 270% / 5 agencies = 54%
Decision Based on Example:

Probability is 54%: Since this is above 50%, you might decide to issue blankets to avoid the higher penalty.
This approach ensures that your decision is based on aggregated data from multiple reliable sources, helping to manage risks effectively and within budget constraints.

"19196019","ensembles_left","7000","A","I used A as reference because it was the safest route.  A would include B and C.  I sent blankets anytime the probability was over around 40%.  I made the decision that was the threshold for me to take my chances.  "
"80a2272a","ensembles_right","1000","Some forecast between B and C","I did not consider line A whatsoever during this task, because it seemed like an outlier, which made me assume that it was less accurate (though it is possible that it may have been even more accurate then the others, but we all love a good old fashioned hive mind.)I didn't necessarily look at one line in specific, but I mostly looked at where the lines tended to clump. If the lines were clumped in the 50% chance or higher region for under 32 degree temperatures, I selected to send blankets.  If the lines were clumped in the 35-ish percent chance (or lower) region for under 32 degree temperatures, I would not send any blankets. The only times I feel that I got most tripped up was when the lines would be group at around the 40-45% chance of under 32 degree temperatures. I assumed it was better to be safe then sorry in the first part of the survey when I was able to see my budget, but in the second part of my survey, when I wasn't able to see my budget, I was a lot ""gutsy-er"" with my choices, which I find kind of interesting. This was a really fun task!"

"2357f654","ensembles_right","7000","B","I worked to average the forecasted % risk of a temperature below 32. Even if one model is an outlier, it has a significant impact on the average. If they're considered of equal reliability, you should weigh outliers more heavily to avoid increased costs"
"bffa105b","ensembles_left","6000","A","If I were making an estimate based on this graph, I would mainly look at the range from B to A. Using this data, it seems like the probability of it being below freezing would be greater than 15 and less than 30, which overall is not too high of a probability. Therefore, I would probably not send blankets."

This number was just a ballpark guess on a good percent of when to send blankets. I also just used the center of B-C for my percent and ignored A past the first task."

"da01216f","ensembles_right","-15000","C","The decision of sending blankets or not was base on how much time was spent during the cold weather, especially during 0 and 32 degrees. If majority was way passed that then I wouldn't send blankets because it was a bit warmer. "
"30a59517","ensembles_left","1000","Other (please describe)","I look over where all the lines intersect with 32, including C, even though it may be an outlier. Most of them combined put the temperature at an estimated 15 to 30% chance of it being below 32, with C pulling in at a 3% chance. Looking at this, I decide not to send blankets. At a 1.5 out of 10 to 3 out of 10 chance of it being under 32, the odds are in the favor that the temperature will remain above 32. I do, however, acknowledge that any percent above 0 is still a possibility.

(Ultimately, if you were not trying to maximize money and the budget, you should just always send blankets to avoid any risk, but budgets are budgets.)"
