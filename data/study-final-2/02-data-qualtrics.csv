Identify Temperature Threshold:

Locate the 32°F mark on the X-axis. This is your critical temperature for alpacas needing blankets.
Analyze Forecasts:

Look at the area under each curve or bar to see how much probability is assigned to temperatures below 32°F.
Calculate Average Probability:

Estimate Area: Approximate the total area under the curves to the left of 32°F.
Aggregate Data: Sum the probabilities provided by each agency for temperatures below 32°F.
Compute Average: Divide this total by the number of agencies (20) to get the average probability.
Assess Variability:

Check if there is a wide range of probabilities. If most agencies forecast a high probability of temperatures below 32°F, this increases your confidence in the risk.
Decision Making:

If the average probability is high (e.g., over 50%): Issue blankets to mitigate the risk of the $5,000 penalty.
If the average probability is low (e.g., below 50%): Consider not issuing blankets to conserve budget, but be aware of the risk of the penalty.
Example Calculation
Let’s say the graph shows the following probabilities from 5 out of 20 agencies for temperatures below 32°F:

Agency 1: 60%
Agency 2: 45%
Agency 3: 55%
Agency 4: 70%
Agency 5: 40%
Steps:

Sum Probabilities: 60% + 45% + 55% + 70% + 40% = 270%
Average Probability: 270% / 5 agencies = 54%
Decision Based on Example:

Probability is 54%: Since this is above 50%, you might decide to issue blankets to avoid the higher penalty.
This approach ensures that your decision is based on aggregated data from multiple reliable sources, helping to manage risks effectively and within budget constraints.

i will send blankets because i wants to prevent larger consequences
